    // what is exception handelling?
    // Exception handelling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors.
    // It is mainly used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program.
    // It is a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.
    // It is a way to separate error handling code from normal code.

    // There are three type of errors: syntax errors, logical errors, and runtime errors. 
    // Syntax errors are detected by the compiler, and the program will not compile.
    // Logical errors are detected by the programmer, and the program will compile and run.
    // Runtime errors are detected by the program while it is running.

    // reason of runtime errors:
    // 1. Bad input  2. probelm with resources 3. unexpected conditions  4. bugs in the code 5. hardware problems 6. network problems 7. etc.
